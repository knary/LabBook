My personal notes about tasks that come up repeatedly, but not so often that they are muscle memory. The information is incompete, probably out of date, and possibly wrong. The organization is inconsistent and arbitrary. It is in a public repo because this way I can access and edit it from anywhere. Some people might find this information useful.

**There should be enough information here to get you into trouble and for me to get myself out of it.**
